    "## Core Conclusions: What Matters and Why\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is actually being measured\n",
    "The goal of the drone-based calibration system is **not** to predict the exact numerical angle that the polarimeter should read, nor to fully model the polarimeter’s internal geometry. In a real experiment, the quantity of interest is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How well the instrument can measure the linear polarization angle of incoming light.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute polarization calibration is therefore about constraining a **constant rotation** between an external reference frame and the instrument’s measurement frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of the drone payload\n",
    "The drone payload acts as an **external polarized reference source**. Using laboratory measurements of the payload and a geometric reconstruction pipeline based on drone position and attitude, the polarization angle of the emitted light can be predicted in a well-defined external frame (e.g., ENU or sky).\n",
    "\n",
    "This predicted angle does **not** need to match the polarimeter’s internal angle convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the polarimeter contributes\n",
    "The ground-based polarimeter measures the incoming polarization angle in its own instrument frame. This measurement includes an unknown but constant offset that absorbs:\n",
    "- the half-wave plate encoder zero,\n",
    "- optical alignment offsets,\n",
    "- internal sign and angle conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This offset is not a problem; it is the **calibration target**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicted vs. measured angle comparison\n",
    "The correct comparison is:\n",
    "- **x-axis:** predicted polarization angle from the drone pipeline\n",
    "- **y-axis:** measured polarization angle from the polarimeter\n",
    "\n",
    "These quantities are expected to follow a linear relationship with:\n",
    "- **unit slope**, and\n",
    "- a **constant intercept**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept represents the total rotation between the external reference frame and the instrument frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Within-run precision\n",
    "Within a single run, many measurements spanning a range of predicted polarization angles can be collected (e.g., by rotating the drone in yaw while maintaining beam pointing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the predicted vs. measured angles yields:\n",
    "- a run-level intercept, and\n",
    "- an uncertainty on that intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uncertainty represents the **within-run statistical precision** and reflects:\n",
    "- polarimeter measurement noise,\n",
    "- HWP fitting uncertainty,\n",
    "- drone attitude reconstruction uncertainty,\n",
    "- payload polarization characterization uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run-to-run repeatability\n",
    "Repeating the experiment across multiple runs produces a distribution of intercept values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter of these intercepts quantifies the **run-to-run repeatability**, capturing:\n",
    "- re-homing and remounting effects,\n",
    "- thermal and mechanical drift,\n",
    "- software and operational variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repeatability is typically the most honest measure of the achievable calibration precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental implication for payload orientation\n",
    "To enable clean sampling of many polarization angles without losing the source:\n",
    "- the payload emission axis should be oriented close to **nadir**,\n",
    "- rotating the drone in yaw should rotate polarization without changing beam pointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids the need for gimbals or complex flight trajectories and keeps the source within the polarimeter field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Final reported result\n",
    "The appropriate final claim is of the form:\n",

    "> *The drone-based system enables calibration of the absolute linear polarization angle of a polarimeter to X degrees.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- **X** is supported by the run-to-run repeatability,\n",
