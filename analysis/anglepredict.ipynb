    "This pipeline is being built **inside-out**, starting from idealized geometry and working outward toward real sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1 — Geometry & Frame Transformations (current)\n",
    "**Goal:** Define how a polarization vector is transported through space and turned into a predicted polarization angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "- Known line-of-sight (LOS)\n",
    "- Known payload attitude\n",
    "- Known constant vectors (e.g. polarization emission direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on:\n",
    "- Reference frames (payload → world/ENU)\n",
    "- Vector rotations\n",
    "- Projection perpendicular to LOS\n",
    "- Construction of the sky-plane basis\n",
    "- Extraction of a polarization angle\n",

    "No real sensor data or hardware noise is involved in this phase.\n",

    "### Phase 2 — Sensor Parsing → Geometry Inputs\n",
    "**Goal:** Turn raw measurements into the geometric inputs required by Phase 1.\n",

    "Implement:\n",
    "- GPS → position → LOS vector (ENU)\n",
    "- IMU + star camera → payload attitude → rotation matrix or quaternion\n",

    "**Goal:** Measure and fix time-independent quantities.\n",

    "Includes:\n",
    "- Polarization emission direction in the payload frame (`p_body`)\n",
    "- Fixed rotations between payload, IMU, and star camera frames\n",

    "# Drone-Based Absolute Polarization Calibration — One-Cell Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Use a drone-mounted polarized source as an external reference to measure a **global instrumental polarization rotation** of a polarimeter (sky-referenced).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Calibration (internal parameters only)\n",
    "In the lab, scan the HWP and fit detector signal vs HWP angle:\n",
    "d(θ) ≈ A cos(4θ + φ_fit) + C  \n",
    "For each lab geometry (different drone positions/orientations), extract **one scalar**: the fitted phase φ_fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known:** drone position & orientation, DRONE→instrument geometry, LOS, HWP angle vs time.  \n",
    "**Unknown:** p_drone (source polarization direction in the DRONE frame, 2 DOF) and φ_HWP (HWP phase zero, a fixed hardware constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward model for configuration i:\n",
    "φ_fit(i) = φ_HWP + 2·ψ_in(i)(p_drone)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here ψ_in(i) is **not known beforehand**; it is a model prediction computed from a *trial* p_drone and the known geometry for configuration i.  \n",
    "By fitting φ_fit across multiple non-degenerate geometries, p_drone and φ_HWP are solved **simultaneously**. This step uses no sky/ENU reference and therefore cannot remove any sky-referenced rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flight / Absolute Calibration\n",
    "With p_drone and φ_HWP fixed, fly the drone and compute the predicted sky-plane polarization angle α_pred from geometry. Measure α_meas from the polarimeter. A constant residual\n",
    "Δα = wrap_180(α_meas − α_pred)\n",
    "is the **global instrumental polarization rotation**; geometry-dependent residuals indicate more complex systematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Conclusions\n",
    "- HWP start position does **not** create a random offset if HWP phase is fitted.\n",
    "- φ_HWP is a stable hardware constant (changes only with mechanical changes).\n",
    "- Fitting p_drone and φ_HWP in the lab does **not** model out global sky-referenced rotation.\n",
    "- The drone provides a true absolute polarization angle check against the sky.\n"
